Kickstarter-data-visualization
==============================

This project involves analyzing and visualizing the behavior of the 16042 Kickstarter campaigns used in the paper "Launch Hard or Go Home! Predicting the Success of Kickstarter Campaigns". I downloaded this data from [this site](http://sidekick.epfl.ch/data) on December 6, 2013 at 9:44pm.

* Program_Files:
  * "extract_project_subset.py" - converts the project data from cPickle dump file to a numpy array file
  * "linear_total_money_histograms.py" - generates histograms of the amount of money the campaigns raised given as a percent of their goal amount; this generated the image "Linear_Histogram_250.png"
  * "success_probability_given_total_money.py" - analyzes the relationship between the percent of campaign goal raised, and the probability of campaign success; this generated the image "success_probability_vs_percent_goal_earned.png"
* Output:
  * "Calling "example.py" from Terminal" - shows the output from running the file "example.py", which came packaged with the data set
  * "exploring_project_status_data.txt" - more closely examines the values stored in the 'projects' numpy array
  * "Linear_Histogram_250.png" - histogram showing the relative numbers of campaigns which raised a given percent of their goal amount; generated by "linear_total_money_histograms.py"
  * "success_probability_vs_percent_goal_earned.png" - plot showing the probability of a campaign's success as a function of the percent of their goal that they earned; generated by "success_probability_given_total_money.py"
